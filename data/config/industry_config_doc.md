Documentation of `industry_config.json` Fields

---

### Industry-level fields

* `occTag`: Determines the OCC category for the industry, used to look up the labor share (RoVC).
* `workerAssignable`: Boolean indicating if the industry can assign workers to outputs.

### Output-level fields (per commodity)

* `baseProd`: Float. Acts as a scaler when `usesWorkers = true`. Represents daily production in units when used alongside InputsPerUnitOutput. The units inside InputsPerUnitOutput are multiplied with it. Default is always 1.
* `CCMoneyDist`: Map\<String, Float>. ConstantCapitalMoneyDistribution Defines **relative monetary allocation** for constant capital inputs (physical or abstract). Weights are normalized internally. Can be used with or without workers. Mutually exclusive with `InputsPerUnitOutput`. Can include abstract inputs.
* `InputsPerUnitOutput`: Map\<String, Float>. Flat input amounts required per output unit. Scales with market/population if `scaleWithMarketSize = true`. Can include abstract inputs.
* `ifMarketCondsAllFalse` / `ifMarketCondsAllTrue`: Lists of conditions affecting output; used to enable/disable production under specific market conditions.
* `scaleWithMarketSize`: Boolean. If true, output and consumption scales proportionally to market size.
* `marketScaleBase`: Float. Determines the per-market-size scaling factor for this output when `scaleWithMarketSize = true`.
* `usesWorkers`: Boolean. Determines if labor calculations (RoVC, LPV\_day) are applied.
* `workerAssignableLimit`: Limits the ratio of globally available workers that can be assigned.
* `isAbstract`: Boolean. Indicates the output is **not physically produced**; used for accounting and value input only.
* `checkLegality`: Boolean. Used to flag outputs that require legality checks.

### Notes on usage

1. **Production with labor** (`usesWorkers = true`):

   * Every labor-driven output must define `CCMoneyDist`. This is required to calculate the variable capital contribution for each input according to the Labor Theory of Value.
   * Workers needed are calculated using OCC and LPV\_day.
   * Total constant capital value `V_cc = P_out * RoCC`.
   * `CCMoneyDist` weights allocate V\_cc to each input.
   * Abstract inputs in `CCMoneyDist` contribute to accounting but have no quantities.

2. **Non-labor production** (`usesWorkers = false`):

   * Output quantity = `baseProd` Ã— `marketScaleBase`^(market_size - 3) (if `scaleWithMarketSize = true`).
   * Consumption requirements from `InputsPerUnitOutput` are scaled accordingly.
   * Inputs are scaled with modifiers from outputs if the output is not abstract.
   * If both CCMoneyDist and InputsPerUnitOutput are present, which is undefined, only CCMoneyDist is used.

3. **Abstract outputs** (`isAbstract = true`):

   * No physical output is generated.
   * Still contributes to value/accounting for RoCC and deficit calculations.

4. **Inputs per Unit Output**:

   * For outputs like `people` or `crew`, `InputsPerUnitOutput` define fixed daily or per-unit consumption of other goods.
   * Quantities are scaled by population size or market size if `scaleWithMarketSize = true`.
   * Abstract consumption entries are accounted for in value but do not produce physical goods.

5. **CCMoneyDist weights**:

   * Do not need to sum to 1; normalized internally. It is **strongly advised**, however.
   * Determines monetary allocation per input based on organic composition of capital (OCC) and output value, which is then converted to quantities.
